uptime is a uptime monitoring tool.
This is a side project and the goal is to add it to my portfolio, so the features that bring in money are not important, it is important to keep the app free, so it's also important to keep the costs low. I'm already paying for servers and mail servers, but the cost of each user using the system should be at a minimum, if anything at all.
